# ml-classification-malicious-network-traffic
This project aims to analyze and classify a real network traffic data set to detect malicious/benign traffic records. It compares the performance of various Machine Learning algorithms and tunes the best-performing model to maintain the highest accuracy and lowest False Negative metrics.

The dataset used in this demo is [CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-34-1](https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/IoT-23-Dataset/IndividualScenarios/CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-34-1/bro/), it is part of [Aposemat IoT-23 dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23) (A labeled dataset with malicious and benign IoT network traffic).

*NOTE: This project is under development and is not ready yet. New updates will be published frequently until the work is finalized!*
